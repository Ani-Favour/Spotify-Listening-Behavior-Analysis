1. Target Prime Listening Windows
 Launch personalized playlists or promotions during peak hours (5-8 PM) and peak days (Fridays)
to maximize engagement.
2. Enhance Repeat Listening Experience
 Introduce a dynamic "Your Repeats" playlist and exclusive content tied to the user's top tracks and
artists to deepen emotional connections.
3. Seasonal Playlist Strategies
 Create seasonal-themed playlists and feature campaigns during the Fall to tap into naturally
higher engagement periods.

algorithms accordingly.


5. Boost Discovery of Favorite Artists
 Offer curated retrospectives or exclusive content from top artists like The Beatles, The Killers, and
John Mayer to encourage ongoing loyalty.
By strategically using these insights, Spotify can tailor experiences, reduce churn, and increase
